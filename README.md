🎮 Fantasy Arena Game 🔥
After countless late nights 🌙 and balancing university 📚, I finally completed my Fantasy Arena Game!

🧙‍♂️ Features:

3 unique characters, each assigned to their own arena 🏟️

Special abilities and dynamic combo attacks 💥

Strategic gameplay with impactful moves ⚔️

One of the toughest parts was coding the combo system and making each character's special feel unique.
